# Welcome

This is a landing repository -- useful largely because my repositories are a mess,
and I'm asking for [sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/jfinkhaeuser). The
least I can do is provide a bit of guidance.

# Python

I write a lot of Python code, but not a lot of it is popular. A bunch isn't
even in a publishable shape.

* [prance](https://github.com/jfinkhaeuser/prance) is an OpenAPI 2 and 3 parser
  that resolves dependencies. That's its main feature, yes.

  People use it to *compile* OpenAPI specs from various places into a single
  file.

  If I find time, I want to add data validation features to it, so it can be
  used as a component in an API server, or for testing purposes.

  **Note**: you can [adopt prance](https://github.com/jfinkhaeuser/prance/issues/91).
    Unfortunately, I do not have spare energy to invest into it.


# C++

My primary language is C++. There are a bunch of projects I've started over
the years, but most haven't seen much use. That's sort of fine with me. Some
have been obsoleted by now.

* [microfsm](https://gitlab.com/jfinkhaeuser/microfsm) is a very tiny
  finite state machine implementation.

  It really started as a teaching example of how one could go about this
  in modern C++, but it turns out it works just fine to be used.


# Peer-to-Peer

Thanks to an EU grant, I can focus on some [peer-to-peer protocol work](https://interpeer.io).
That's how I'd like to spend a lot of my time, to be honest, and only
sponsorship can carry it through to a fruitful conclusion.

There is a [GitLab organization](https://gitlab.com/interpeer/) with a repository overview.
