# Welcome

This is a landing repository -- useful largely because my repositories are a mess,
and I'm asking for [sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/jfinkhaeuser). The
least I can do is provide a bit of guidance.

# C++

My primary language is C++. There are a bunch of projects I've started over
the years, but most haven't seen much use. That's sort of fine with me. Some
have been obsoleted by now.

* [microfsm](https://codeberg.org/jfinkhaeuser/microfsm) is a very tiny
  finite state machine implementation.

  It really started as a teaching example of how one could go about this
  in modern C++, but it turns out it works just fine to be used.

# Peer-to-Peer

Thanks to some grants, I can focus on some [next generation internet work](https://interpeer.io).
That's how I'd like to spend a lot of my time, to be honest, and only
sponsorship can carry it through to a fruitful conclusion.

There are [a bunch of related repositories](https://codeberg.org/interpeer) over
on Codeberg.
